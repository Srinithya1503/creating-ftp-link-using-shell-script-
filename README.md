As the provision to download ftp links as one of the paramters  in NCBI genome is not being available now and you are in need of ftp link to download files , the below mentioned would be one of the best solution:

you require a TSV file which contains accession number, assembly name and organism name 
use the shell script i attached to create the ftp link in the format "ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/195/955/GCF_000195955.2_ASM19595v2".
Using these ftp links you can download files related to assembly statistics, genome statistics, transcriptomics and proteomics of the corressponding assemblies of species using certain shell script by directly interacting with NCBI Genome FTP site.
